# blotion

Turn a Notion database into a blog.

How it works

1. Copy the template into your own Notion Workspace and edit as desired.
2. Go back to blotion.com and Login with Notion. This installs an integration on your Notion workspace that allows blotion to access only the pages you allow.
3. blotion generates a new site for you.
4. You can manage and create new site just by logging in again with Notion.
